GCP Configuration
=================

The minimum required configuration parameters for running ElasticBLAST in GCP include:

* :ref:`project <elb_gcp_project>`
* :ref:`region <elb_gcp_region>`
* :ref:`zone <elb_gcp_zone>`

In addition, you must be authenticated with the GCP project in the environment you are working on.
A convenient way to accomplish this is to work on the `GCP cloud shell <https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true>`_.
