ElasticBLAST, version |release|
===============================

ElasticBLAST is a cloud-based tool to run your searches faster and make you more effective.

ElasticBLAST is ideal for users who have 100,000 or more queries to BLAST.  It distributes your queries to machines in the cloud and runs them more quickly than you could with stand-alone BLAST.

It runs on AWS and GCP and requires that you have an account on one of those cloud providers.

Currently, ElasticBLAST is alpha software
