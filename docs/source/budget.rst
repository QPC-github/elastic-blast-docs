.. _budget:

Setting budgets and budget alerts
=================================


ElasticBLAST runs the bulk of its compute workload on cloud service providers
which typically have a pay-as-you-go model. These  cloud service providers
typically provide means to monitor the expenses you incur as well as to issue
alerts if budgets are exceeded. We recommend that you use these tools if you
have budgetary constraints, as you are responsible for monitoring and paying
for cloud expenses incurred on your behalf by elastic-blast.
